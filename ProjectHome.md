BlueRemote is a Palm OS application that implements the Bluetooth Human Interface Device (HID) Profile.  You can use it to turn your Palm OS device into a remote control for your computer â€” it's great for controlling your Home Theater PC or for use as a presentation clicker.

BlueRemote emulates a standard Bluetooth peripheral, so it doesn't need special server software to talk to.  It can pair with and control any computer running Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, and more: it can control any device that supports the Bluetooth HID profile. Notable examples include Sony's PlayStation 3 and Apple's iOS devices. Use Graffiti to chat on PSN! Input text on your iPhone using your Treo's QWERTY keyboard!

Developed in 2006 and previously distributed commercially, BlueRemote is now free software, licensed under GPL v2.  It works with Bluetooth-enabled Palm OS 5 (Garnet) devices. It has been tested on Palm Tungsten T, T2, T3, LifeDrive, Treo 650, Treo 680 and Treo 700p devices, but it will likely run on similar models as well.

BlueRemote 2.0 was released on March 25, 2011. Bug reports and code contributions are most welcome!
